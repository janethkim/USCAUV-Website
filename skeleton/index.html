      <p>We might be the most interesting and diverse group of individuals you'll ever meet in your whole life. Plus we get along in a way that's almost uncanny. Building robots is basically our whole life. If we're not in lab, we're thinking about being in lab. If we are in lab, we're kind of upset about it honestly. But we persevere. We solve bugs. We order new parts. We get things done. Once we hung out outside of lab. How are we so great? Some say it's luck. Others say it's just the magic of iLab.</p>

      <p>Every year we compete in a competition put on by perhaps the most incredible orgnization known to mankind. In order to win, we have to get our robot to swim around, touch buoys, follow underwater paths, avoid sharks, rescue some treasured friends tied up at the bottom of the lake, all while avoiding the Giant Squid. Sounds impossible doesn't it? We thought so too. Then we tried to do it, and realized it really is pretty hard. But every day we're making great progress, and soon we'll be holding that Robotics Cup high to the cheers of friends and family, and that'll show 'em!</p>

      <p>Did you know SeaBee is a famous actress? She really is! She's been in several hit movies, such as Batman: Dark Buoy, The Thirsty Games, Star Wars Episode MXII: Return of the Pinger, and she has a lead role in the upcoming classic Les Submersibles! This page has a few clips from her movies, as well as pictures and stuff. Definitely worth looking at.</p>

      <p>Supporting the leaders (and engineers) of tomorrow is perhaps one of the noblest pursuits man (and woman!) is capable of. What better way to ensure the success of the human race than to fund needy students? Your support will help us cure SeaBee's ills and undermine her woes. Your money will help feed our hungry, destitute programmers. Maybe we can even buy a microwave so we don't have to heat old discarded pizzas with the hot exhaust of our horrible, bloated computers. If we had just $1000 extra dollars per day, we would probably find the cure for cancer under the sea or something. Think about that. You can make it happen. Support us!</p>
